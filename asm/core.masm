; Register allocation
; ===================
;
; 8 general-purpose registers, plus SP.
; - SP has fancy instructions, so we use it for Smalltalk push and pop,
;   pointing it into the Smalltalk stacks.
; - J is the context being executed.
; - I is the Smalltalk PC.
; - Z is the allocation pointer.
; - Y is the next identity hash.
; I think those are the most vital. nextIdentityHash is used ~as much.
